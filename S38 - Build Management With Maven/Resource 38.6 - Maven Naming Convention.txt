Maven Naming Convention


In the next lecture we will migrate the project to Maven and run the Maven project using Maven commands.

It is very important to keep the naming convention in mind when creating test classes in maven. If we do not follow the naming convention then build will be successful but test cases will not run.

By default Maven uses the following naming conventions when looking for tests to run:

    Test*
    *Test
    *TestCase

It means your test class name should be Test  in the file name.
Valid Example file names:

    LoginTest.java
    TestLogin.java
    LoginTestCase.java
